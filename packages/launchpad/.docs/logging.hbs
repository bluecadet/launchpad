# Logging

All logs are routed to and handled by [Winston](https://www.npmjs.com/package/winston) by the [LogManager](packages\utils\lib\log-manager.js) class.

Logs are funneled to:
- The console with colorization
- Launchpad log files for `info`, `error` and `debug` with no colorization
- App log files for `stdout` and `stderr` with no colorization

## Configuration

To log everything up to the debug level, you can start launchpad with:

```
npx launchpad --logging.level=debug
```

Available log levels are: error

0. `error`
1. `warn`
2. `info`
3. `http`
4. `verbose`
5. `debug`
6. `silly`

All settings can be configured via `launchpad.json` or by passing in the appropriate CLI launch flag (e.g. `--logging.fileOptions.dirname=my-logs` to save logs to `my-logs/`).

## Capturing Application Logs

Launchpad routes all the `stdout` and `stderr` logs of all apps to the console and file based the settings [LogManager](packages\utils\lib\log-manager.js). See [Launchpad Monitor](/packages/monitor/README.md#logging-app-output) for more info.
