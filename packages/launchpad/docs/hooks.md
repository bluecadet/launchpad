# Event Hooks

You can configure Launchpad to execute custom scripts before or after any of the central commands.

## Example

Hooks can be configured in `launchpad.json`. For example:

```json
{
	"hooks": {
		"post-update-content": ["npm run build"],
		"pre-start-apps": ["taskkill /im chrome.exe /f"]
	}
}
```

Multiple hooks can be passed per event:

```json
"post-update-content": ["echo one", "echo two"]
```

## Available Hooks

| Order | Command | Hook | Description |
| - | - | - | - |
| 1. | `startup` | `pre-startup` | Before content is updated and apps are launched (config and logger will already be initialized by then). |
| 2. | `update-content` | `pre-update-content` | Before any content is updated. |
| 3. | `update-content` | `post-update-content` | After all content has been updated. |
| 4. | `start-apps` | `pre-start-apps` | Before any app is started. |
| 5. | `start-apps` | `post-start-apps` | After all apps have been started. |
| 6. | `startup` | `post-startup` | After content has been updated and apps have been started. |
| 7. | `shutdown` | `pre-shutdown` | Before launchpad is shut down. |
| 8. | `stop-apps` | `pre-stop-apps` | Before any apps are stopped. |
| 9. | `stop-apps` | `post-stop-apps` | After all apps were stopped. |
| 10. | `shutdown` | `post-shutdown` | After all apps have been stopped and just before launchpad will shutdown. |
