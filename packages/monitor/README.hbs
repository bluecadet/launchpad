# Launchpad Monitor

The [`@bluecadet/launchpad-monitor`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@bluecadet/launchpad-monitor) package launches and monitors any number of apps.

Under the hood, it uses PM2 for process management, and adds a few features like window foregrounding and minimizing.

## Configuration

1. Create a `monitor` section in your `launchpad.json` (see [`MonitorOptions`](#MonitorOptions)).
2. Add a list of app option objects in `monitor.apps` (see [`AppOptions`](#AppOptions)).
3. Each app requires a `pm2` block, which requires a `name` and `script` as a minimum. See [PM2 docs](https://pm2.keymetrics.io/docs/usage/application-declaration/#attributes-available) for all supported settings.
4. Run `npx launchpad monitor` (or `npx launchpad` to update content first if configured)

```json
{
  "monitor": {
    "apps": [
      {
        "pm2": {
          "name": "my-app",
          "script": "my-app.exe"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Apps will be relaunched individually as soon as they exit.

## Example: Monitor Two Apps

The following `launchpad.json` will launch and monitor two apps. The first app window will be foregrounded after launch, the second app will be minimized. If any of the apps exit, PM2 will relaunch them.

```json
{
  "monitor": {
    "apps": [
      {
        "pm2": {
          "name": "main-app",
          "script": "my-main-app.exe",
          "cwd": "../apps/"
        },
        "windows": {
          "foreground": true
        }
      },
      {
        "pm2": {
          "name": "side-app",
          "script": "my-side-app.exe",
          "cwd": "../apps/",
          "args": "--custom-arg=true"
        },
        "windows": {
          "minimize": true
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
